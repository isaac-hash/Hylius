# Deploying Your App (`hylius deploy`)

The `hylius deploy` command pushes your application to your VPS using an **atomic symlink-swap** strategy — ensuring zero-downtime for every deployment.

---

## How Deployment Works

```
1. Clone your Git repo into a timestamped release directory on the VPS
2. Build a Docker image (Dockerfile → Railpack → Nixpacks, in that order)
3. Start the new container(s)
4. Atomically swap the symlink from the old release to the new one
5. Old container is gracefully stopped
```

Every release directory is retained on the server, making instant rollbacks possible.

---

## Running `hylius deploy`

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
hylius deploy
```

🔍 Configuration needed for deployment

? VPS Host IP:              › 203.0.113.42
? VPS Username:             › root
? SSH Port:                 › 22
? Target Path on VPS:       › /var/www/my-app
? Git Repository URL:       › https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
? Authentication Method:    › SSH Agent (Recommended)
```

After answering, you'll see live server logs as your app builds and starts:

```
[Server] Step 1/8 : FROM node:20-alpine
[Server] Step 2/8 : WORKDIR /app
[Server] ...

## Deployment Strategies

Hylius selects a build strategy based on what exists in your project root:

| Strategy | Trigger | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Docker Compose** | `compose.yaml` exists | Runs `docker compose up -d --build` |
| **Dockerfile** | `Dockerfile` exists (no compose) | Builds and runs a single container |
| **Auto-generate** | Neither exists | Railpack detects your stack and generates Docker artifacts |

> [!TIP]
> You don't need a `Dockerfile` to deploy. Hylius will detect your project type (Node.js, Python, PHP, Go, etc.) via Railpack and generate the right Docker configuration automatically.

## Deploying a Local Directory

You can deploy directly from a local folder without pushing to GitHub first:

```bash
hylius deploy
# When asked for Git Repository URL, enter a local path:
? Git Repository URL: › ./  (or an absolute path like /home/username/my-app)
```

Hylius will:
1. Bundle your project (excluding `node_modules`, `.git`, `.next`, `dist`)
2. Upload the archive over SSH (SFTP)
3. Deploy from the uploaded bundle

This is useful for:
- Hot fixes that aren't committed yet
- Deploying monorepo sub-packages
- Testing before pushing to Git

---

## Environment Variables on the VPS

Hylius does not manage environment variables for you at the CLI level. The recommended approach is to create a `.env` file directly on your VPS in the deployment target directory:

```bash
# SSH into your VPS
ssh root@YOUR_VPS_IP

# Create your env file in the deploy path
nano /var/www/my-app/.env
```

Your `compose.yaml` or `Dockerfile` should then reference it with `env_file: .env`.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use the **Hylius Dashboard**, environment variables can be managed through the web UI under **Projects → Env Variables**. The dashboard's GitHub Actions CI pipeline fetches them automatically at build time.

---

## CI/CD Mode (Headless Deployment)

When the `CI` or `GITHUB_ACTIONS` environment variable is set, `hylius deploy` requires no prompts and reads config from env vars:

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `HYLIUS_HOST` | VPS IP address | Yes |
| `HYLIUS_REPO_URL` | Git URL to clone on the server | Yes |
| `HYLIUS_TARGET_PATH` | Remote path to deploy into | Yes |
| `HYLIUS_USER` | SSH username | No (defaults to `root`) |
| `HYLIUS_PORT` | SSH port | No (defaults to `22`) |
| `HYLIUS_SSH_KEY` | Full SSH private key content | Auth required |
| `HYLIUS_SSH_KEY_PATH` | Path to private key file | Auth required |
| `HYLIUS_PASSWORD` | SSH password | Auth required |
| `HYLIUS_BRANCH` | Git branch to clone | No (defaults to `main`) |
| `HYLIUS_BUILD_COMMAND` | Build command | No (defaults to `npm run build`) |
| `HYLIUS_START_COMMAND` | Start command | No (defaults to PM2) |

### Example `.env` for CI testing:

```bash
HYLIUS_HOST=203.0.113.42
HYLIUS_USER=root
HYLIUS_SSH_KEY="-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\n..."
HYLIUS_REPO_URL=https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
HYLIUS_TARGET_PATH=/var/www/my-app
```

## Framework-Specific Tips

### Node.js / Next.js

Make sure your app listens on `0.0.0.0` and not `localhost`:

```js
// next.config.js — no change needed, Next.js binds correctly by default

// For custom express/node servers:
app.listen(3000, '0.0.0.0');
```

### Python / FastAPI

Bind Uvicorn to `0.0.0.0` so Docker port mapping works:

```python
# main.py
if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

### Laravel (PHP)

Add the `pdo_pgsql` extension if you're using PostgreSQL:

```json
// composer.json
"require": {
    "ext-pdo_pgsql": "*"
}
```

Then run `hylius deploy` (or redeploy from the dashboard) to rebuild the container with the new extension.

---

## After Deployment

Your app is live! To verify:

```bash
curl http://YOUR_VPS_IP
# or
curl http://YOUR_VPS_IP:PORT
```

To automate future deploys on every `git push`, see the [CI/CD Guide](./CI-CD.md).
